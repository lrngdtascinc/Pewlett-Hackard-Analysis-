# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Goals 
The main goal of this analysis was too format the data from Pewlett-Hackard and go thru it to figure out how many employees are about to retire, and to find which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This will help streamline the process of assigning mentors to those who are eligible to save the company time and money.

## Results

* From looking at the amount of employees in the mentorship eligibility chart compared to the amount of retiring employees in the retirement charts we can see that there aren't many oppurtunities for employees seeking mentorship to find a mentor.

* If we look at the retiring titles chart and calculate the sum of all retiring positions we see that for the upcoming "silver tsunami" the company will have to be able to fill 90,398 positions.

* when we check the unique titles chart we see that the number of available mentors is 1,549 which doesnt even come close to the amount of positions that needs to be filled.

## Wrapping it Up
If we look at the upcoming "Silver Tsunami" we can see that Pewlett-Hackard will be left with 90,398 open positions that would need to be filled. Unfortunately, the amount of employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program is a meager 1,549 employees. This means that there arent enough mentors to help bring up the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. One solution to this problem would be to assign multiple employees to single mentors almost like a classroom setting where the mentors will be trainig a class of employees that will be assuming new positions in the mentors old field. The problems with this solution are location to hold the classes, the time the classes would take, the more broad approach to teaching as apposed to a more one on one approach, and the student to mentor ratio. Although the amount of mentors is not enough to train the amount of employees that would be needed to fill the positions needed, my classroom approach could help spread the knowledge of one mentor to multiple new employees, albeit with a few issues.
